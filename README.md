# Lux

Lux was a desktop app I wrote meant for keeping notes as you translate Latin. It doesn't translate Latin for you - rather it allows you to mark up Latin text much like you would be able to on paper if it were to be printed double spaced. I never finished the project due to actually needing to study for Latin.
